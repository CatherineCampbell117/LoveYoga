		<!-- ETIQUETTE RULES -->
		<section>
			<div id="studioetiquette">
			<h2 class="aboutheading">Studio Etiquette</h2>
				<div class="Etiquette">
					<p class="Rule">1. No Admittance to Class After it Starts</p>
					<p>Arrive at least 10 minutes before your class starts as late arrivals are disruptive to other clients and can distract the  teacher. It is also not advisable to miss the warm up. Our classes are  regularly full with waitlists so your space will be given to someone else if you are not here on time.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="Etiquette">
					<p class="Rule">2. Let us Know How to Help You</p>
					<p>Notify the instructor before every class if you have any special medical considerations, injuries, or prefer to not have hands-on adjustments. If you are pregnant you should only participate in our pregnancy classes. Not all of our teachers are qualified to instruct mums-to-be.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="Etiquette">
					<p class="Rule">3. Technology Free Zones</p>
					<p>No cameras or cell phones are allowed in the studio. If you are awaiting an emergency call, then please leave your phone with our reception team and we will get you if required. Do not take photos once you are in the studios or changing areas.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="Etiquette">
					<p class="Rule">4. Keep the Zen. Shhh!</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise instructed please do not speak in class. As we have two studios in close proximity please keep noise to a minimum in the changing area to respect the clients in class.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="Etiquette">
					<p class="Rule">5. Chill Out & Be Kind to All</p>
					<p>We understand stuff happens out of your control. However, our rules are carefully thought out and are in place for everyone’s safety and wellbeing. Please keep it chill!</p>
